# Welcome!
I obtained my B.S. degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology from Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang, China, in 2021. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Electronic and Communication Engineering at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2025. Additionally, I serve as a visiting scholar at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), where I am under the guidance of Prof. Tony Q.S. Quek, from 2024 to 2025. I am currently a Research Fellow in Signal Processing and Machine Learning at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). I have published over 20 refereed journal papers and over 10 Chinese patents in the field of signal processing. In particular, my research interests include statistical signal processing, DOA estimating, source localization and intelligent reflecting surface.
